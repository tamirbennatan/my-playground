Load libraries
```{R}
library(knitr)
library(devtools)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
```

Load kicker data
```{R}
df_k <- read.csv("../processed_data/player_data/K/K.csv")
head(df_k)
```


```{R}
g1 <- qplot(df_k$FG.Att)
g2 <- qplot(df_k$Pct)
g3 <- qplot(df_k$XP.Att)
g4 <- qplot((df_k$XP.Made/df_k$XP.Att)*100)
grid.arrange(g1, g2, g3, g4, ncol = 2)
```

Kickers make most of their fieldgoals and extra points. Therefore, I want kickers that see the most attempts. 

Add next year's fantasy points (resopnse variable)
```{R}
df_k <- df_k %>%
      group_by(Player, year) %>%
      mutate(Next.Fantasy.Points = lead(n = 1, Fantasy.Points,order_by = week) ) %>%
      ungroup()
```

Add a series of statistics from prevoius season
```{R}
df_k <- df_k %>% 
      left_join(
            df_k %>% 
                  group_by(Player, year) %>%
                  summarize(Previous.Avg.FG.Att = mean(FG.Att),
                            Previous.Avg.FG.Made = mean(FG.Made), 
                            Previous.Avg.Pct = mean(Pct), 
                            Previous.Avg.XP.Made = mean(XP.Made), 
                            Previous.Avg.XP.Att = mean(XP.Att)  ) %>%
                  ungroup() %>%
                  mutate(next.year = year + 1),
            by = c("year" = "next.year", "Player" = "Player")
      )
```

Add some cumuative statistics
```{R}
df_k <- df_k %>%
      group_by(Player, year) %>%
      arrange(week) %>%
      mutate(
            Cum.Avg.FG.Att = cummean(FG.Att), 
            Cum.Avg.FG.Made = cummean(FG.Made), 
            Cum.Avg.Pct = cummean(Pct), 
            Cum.Avg.XP.Made = cummean(XP.Made), 
            Cum.Avg.XP.Att = mean(XP.Att)
      ) 
```
keep only 2012+ data to fit model on, since 2011 is the first year in the dataset and I'm using statistics from previous year.

```{R}
test <- df_k %>% filter(year > 2011)
test[is.na(test)] = 0
```

Fit dummy model
```{R}
#Dummy model
model <- lm(data = test, Next.Fantasy.Points ~ Previous.Avg.FG.Att  + Previous.Avg.XP.Att + Cum.Avg.FG.Att )      

summary(model)
```
 
 

Add predicitions
```{R}

test$Predictions = predict(model)
test$Residuals = resid(model)
```

```{R}
qplot(test$Residuals)
plot(model)
```


### Prioritize players for lineup
```{R}
      predictions <- test %>% 
            mutate(max_year = max(year)) %>% 
            filter(year == max_year) %>% #keep only most recent year's predictions
            group_by(Player) %>% #group by player to get the most recent week the player has played
            mutate(max_week = max(week)) %>% 
            mutate(Previous.Avg.Fantasy.Points = NA) %>%
            filter(week == max_week) %>% #Only keep each player's last week predictions
            select (Player, Team, Pos, year, week, Previous.Avg.Fantasy.Points, Predictions) %>% #Information I'd like to see when chosing lineup
            arrange(desc(Predictions)) %>%
            ungroup() %>%
            top_n(20)

      predictions
```

```{R}
#Write predictions
write.csv(predictions, "../predictions/week-1/K.csv")
```
